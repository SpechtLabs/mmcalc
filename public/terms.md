2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
   mmcalc.de is a free online calculator that converts camera lens focal length and aperture values between different sensor sizes and their full-frame (35mm) equivalent. The Service provides a web-based interface for interactive calculations and a plain-text API accessible via command-line tools (e.g. curl). Users can compare multiple lens and sensor combinations side by side. The Service does not require registration, does not collect personal data, and does not process payments.

3. USER OBLIGATIONS
   You agree not to:
   3.1. Send excessive automated requests to the Service in a manner that degrades availability for other users.

You may freely use the Service for personal and commercial purposes (e.g. looking up equivalent values for your photography work). You may not clone or redistribute the Service itself without permission.

5. ACCURACY DISCLAIMER
   Calculation results are approximations based on standard optical equivalence formulas. Actual results may vary depending on specific camera and lens combinations. The equivalent aperture calculation reflects depth of field equivalence only and does not affect exposure. We make no warranty regarding the accuracy of results for any specific use case.

6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
   THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS-IS" AND "AS-AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.
